🧪 Recommendation Approach (Cocktail Method)

The system uses a hybrid (cocktail) recommendation approach:

Content-Based Filtering – Recommends destinations similar to user’s past choices

Collaborative Filtering – Suggests based on other users with similar interests

Knowledge-Based Filtering – Uses rules and constraints (e.g., budget, climate, location type)

Final Recommendation – Weighted combination of the above methods
